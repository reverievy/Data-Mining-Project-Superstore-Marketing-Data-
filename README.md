# Data-Mining-Project-Superstore-Marketing-Data-

ðŸ“ŠÂ **Quick-read!**

For my Data Mining for Business course at Drexel (2023), I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed predictive models to identify high-value customer segments and aid the Marketing team in refining a data-driven targeting strategy for the Superstoreâ€™s upcoming premium membership campaign.

The analysis highlights key customer segments based on past purchasing behaviors and online engagement. Key traits of high-value customers include **high spending on wine and gold products**, **frequent website visits, recent purchases**, and **active catalog shopping**.

This project strengthened my ability to conduct exploratory analysis in complex datasets, bridging the gap between data science and business decision-making.

**Stakeholders:** Marketing, Sales, Merchandising, and Operations
