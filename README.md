# Data-Mining-Project-Superstore-Marketing-Data-

üìä¬†**Quick-read!**

For my Data Mining for Business course at Drexel (2023), I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed predictive models to identify high-value customer segments and aid the Marketing team in refining a data-driven targeting strategy for the Superstore‚Äôs upcoming premium membership campaign.

This project strengthened my ability to conduct exploratory analysis in complex datasets and utilize supervised learning techniques (Decision Trees) in informing business decision-making.

The analysis highlights key customer segments based on past purchasing behaviors and online engagement. Key traits of high-value customers include **high spending on wine and gold products**, **frequent website visits, recent purchases**, and **active catalog shopping**.

üìç **Stakeholders:** Marketing, Sales, Merchandising, and Operations

üìç **Technical Skills:** R Studio, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Decision Trees (CART & C4.5).




## **Project Description**

Ahead of the holiday **premium membership promotion**, the Superstore sought to refine its marketing strategy by prioritizing customers most likely to engage. Since follow-ups are time-intensive and costly, the marketing team aimed to **identify key customer profiles** that warrant higher engagement efforts.


### **Key Actions Taken**

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, including *variable distribution plots, correlation matrix analysis*, and *data preprocessing*.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built Decision Tree models (CART & C4.5) to classify and predict customer responses.
- **Customer Profiling:** Identified behavioral and transactional patterns that correlated with positive responses.

### **Business Insights & Outcomes**

The analysis provided a **clear customer segmentation** based on past purchasing behaviors and online engagement. Key traits of responsive customers included **high spending on wine and gold products, frequent website visits, recent purchases, and active catalog shopping**.

From these insights, the marketing and sales teams could:

‚úÖ **Refine targeting strategies** by focusing on customers fitting these behavioral profiles.

‚úÖ **Prioritize high-value leads** to maximize conversion rates and reduce wasted follow-ups.

‚úÖ **Improve resource allocation** by directing efforts toward the most responsive segments.
